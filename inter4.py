#Geeta needs to jump on slippery logs across a river:

 #   She starts at the bank (before log 0).

  #  She can jump right up to Y positions or left up to X positions.

   # She must land only on the right edge of a log.

   # If stuck, she returns to the starting bank.

    #You need to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the opposite bank or back.

# Difficulty: Medium to Hard
# Concept: BFS traversal with directional constraints
# Skills: Custom BFS, careful edge-case handling, state tracking

 #   The challenge lies in understanding directional constraints: left jump (X), right jump (Y), and bank entry/exit.

  #  Also, understanding how the logs behave as platforms makes this conceptually deeper.
